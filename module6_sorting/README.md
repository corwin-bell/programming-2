# Module 6 Option 1: Selection Sort with user defined comparator
Create a Java program that will store 10 student objects in an ArrayList, ArrayList<Student>. A student object consists of the following fields:
 * int rollno
 * String name
 * String address
Implement two comparator classes to sort student objects by name and by rollno (roll number). Implement your own selection sort method and place your code in a separate Java source file. Do not use a sort method from the Java collections library.
