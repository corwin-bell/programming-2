# Module 2 Option 1: Creating a GUI Bank Balance Application
Create a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) Bank Balance application. The application must obtain the BankAccount balance from a user, and then display that balance within a JPanel when the user selects a button. The program should allow for the user to deposit and withdraw funds from their account using a simple interface. The remaining balance in the account should be displayed before exiting the program. Ensure that your application includes the following components:
- JPanel
- JButton
- ActionListener
